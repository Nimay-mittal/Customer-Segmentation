This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment ~9,000 credit card users based on 18 behavioral features. Using KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models, four distinct customer groups were identified (e.g., high spenders, low users, installment-heavy customers).

An interactive Streamlit dashboard was built to visualize clusters with PCA, heatmaps, and boxplots, and to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
